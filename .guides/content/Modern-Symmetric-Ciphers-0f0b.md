There are several [symmetric ciphers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric-key_algorithm) that are in use today.  For example the secure network protocol TLS/SSL (Transport layer Security/Secure Socket Layer) lists the following block ciphers in its suite of ciphers

- [RC4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RC4)
- [Triple DES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_DES)
- [AES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AES)
- [IDEA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Data_Encryption_Algorithm)
- [DES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Encryption_Standard)
- [Camellia ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camellia_(cipher))
