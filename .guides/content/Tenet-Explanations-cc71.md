## Confidentiality 
Confidentiality is the concept of ensuring that data is not made available or disclosed to unauthorized people. Confidentiality, achieved through encryption, was the original purpose of cryptography.

**Encryption/decryption algorithms** are used to ensure that data is not made available to unauthorized persons, which weâ€™ll dig into later.

## Integrity 
Integrity is the concept of ensuring that data has not been altered in any way. **Hash functions** are commonly used for this purpose.

## Authenticity
Authenticity ensures that the data came from the stated sender. **Digital signatures** and  **digital certificates** are used in this process.

## Nonrepudiation	
Nonrepudiation is the assurance that someone cannot deny something. Typically, nonrepudiation refers to the ability to ensure that a party to a contract or a communication cannot deny the authenticity of their signature on a document or the sending of a message that they originated.
