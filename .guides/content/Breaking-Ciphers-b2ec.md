- What is the key space? How many keys are there?
- How many permutations are there in the English alphabet?

Consider that there are 26 choices for mapping A, then 25 choices for mapping B, 24 for C etc. Using the multiplication principle, we get

$$ 26 \times 25 \times 24 \times ... \times 2 \times 1 = 26! $$

This is a number of $10^{26}$ or $2^{88}$, a huge number for brute force.
