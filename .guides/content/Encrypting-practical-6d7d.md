Let's play with a real example.

You will see some plain text on the left hand side. This file is the text you want to encrypt. Go ahead and change the plain text to anything you like.

Then, press the button below to encrypt the file using the Caesar Cipher. You will see the encrypted text in the panel below it. 

{Encrypt}(.guides/caesare.sh)

Once you are done, try decrypting on the next page.
