The Caesar cipher takes each character of a text message and then shifts each letter in the message N letters to the right in the alphabet

### Example
In the following example, the *key* is 3. Each letter is shifted 3 letters to the right in the alphabet.

```
meet me after the toga party
PHHW PH DIWHU WKH WRJD SDUWB
```

Notice how the last N letters (3 in the above example) are dealt with by starting again at the letter A if it would go past Z.

If you know a ciphertext is obtained using Caesar Cipher, getting the original plaintext is simple.
