Feel free to experiment with the file contents. You can run the encryption and decryption using the buttons below.

{Encrypt}(.guides/caesare.sh)
{Decrypt}(.guides/caesard.sh)

If you are interested, you can also see two programs written in Python that handle the encryption and decryption.

`caesar-encrypt.py` handles the encryption
`caesar-decrypt.py` handles the decryption

You can open these up by clicking on them in the file tree.

If you like, you can change the key from 3 to another value. Make sure you change the key in both programs, though.
